# Places App

A full-stack app that allows users to track different places they have travelled to.

Users are able to enter the name of the place they travelled to, the city, country, and state/province where that place is located, the date the user travelled to that specific place, as well as rate the overall experience they had at that place on a scale from 1-5. Similarly users are also able to enter how expensive that place they travelled to was on a scale from 1-5. Users can also update the info they entered for a certain place as well as delete a place altogether.
